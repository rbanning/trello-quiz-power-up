    We are nearing the end of the 
    <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/tag/trello-holiday/tg-p" target="_blank">Trello Holiday Calendar</a>
    and I must say that I have really enjoyed reading all of the posts in 
    this series.
    For the penultimate posting, I wanted to do something a bit different.  In our house, 
    we look forward to the 24th so we can follow Santa's trek across the globe as he visits all
    of the nice kids. <a href="https://www.noradsanta.org/en/" target="_blank">NORAD Santa Tracker</a>
    shows Santa's progress during his tip around the world.

    I have created a Trello Board <strong><a href="https://trello.com/b/MSb9wYXE/santa-tracker" target="_blank">Santa Tracker</a></strong>
    that consists of a 49 cards representing cities across the world.  As Santa visits each city, 
    the card is transformed to include some surprises.  One of these "surprises" is a Trello Tips and Tricks quiz
    to test your Trello expertise.  When you open a card (where Santa has visited), you will see a sky blue button "Answer Question"
    which will allow you to enter your answer.  
    <em>
      NOTE: this uses a custom power up that I created so a) you need to view the board on the web and not using the mobile app, 
      and b) this power up is in beta so who know what bugs will surface. :-) 
    </em>

    Researching all of these questions has make me realize just how much I can learn about Trello.  
    For example, I never knew you could paste a URL for another Trello Card into a checklist item
     and Trello formats the item as a link to the card.  Thank you <em>@hannahmorg</em> for
